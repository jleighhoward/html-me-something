    <p>During the Summer of 2018 I had the opportunity to take a trip to England with my mother. The trip 
        impacted my perspective on life in the United States as well as teaching me more about the day to day
        of the UK. While I was there I got to expirience and enjoy many different important cultural and
        histroical places. </p></header>
    <article id="thisOne"><h2>tarting with Stonghenge</h2>
    <p>We flew into the London Oxford Airport on August 13th and took a cab to our Airbnb in Salisbury. It 
        was our first, (and only time to date), staying in a yurt! We stayed for two days and visited the
        mysterious Stongehenge and the surrounding towns. We stopped to view the Wilton House which has 
        been in one of my favorite movies, Pride and Prejudice.</p>
    <h2>A Rejuvenating Bath</h2>
    <p>After our nights in the yurt, we continued on to our next destination: Bath. Bath is
        an astonishly structured city. In some areas it just seems that there are miles of endless tall homes
        called flats. In others there are some beautiful shops and bakeries, my favorite being a quaint flower
        we passed daily during our stay. During our stay we took an entire day to spend at Thermae Bath Spa.
        We were able to swim in the rooftop pool, get a facial and massage, and finally enjoy an exquiste 
        meal to end our stay.</p>
    <h2>London Is Calling</h2>
    <p>Feeling relaxed and refreshed, we headed to London! We stayed for five nights and got to see some
        amazing places. We visited Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace, not including 
        the restaurants, markets, greenery, and other places along the way! 
        
        
        My personal favorite part of our
        visit was the St. Pancras Train Station, where we got to see the recently built light sculpture. I was
        so moved by seeing a piece of art that really embodied what this trip really meant to me, time with my
        mother that I knew would be coming to an end, much quicker than I anticpated.
